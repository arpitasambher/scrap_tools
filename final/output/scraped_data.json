Vijay Mallya in Raj Shamani podcast \u00a0 Credits: YouTube Screengrab In his first detailed response to various charges levelled against him since 2016, fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya, who is facing extradition to India in a UK court, appeared on Raj Shamani\u2019s podcast\u00a0 Figuring Out , and spoke at length on key topics around his companies and his way of doing business, his rise and fall in the Indian business space, and his legal battles. Mallya, known as the \u201cKing of Good Times\u201d for his flamboyant lifestyle, also spoke freely about labels like \"fugitive\" and \"thief,\" the allegations of money laundering, and the extradition and court cases against him.\u00a0 On being called a fugitive, and theft\u00a0and money laundering allegations Mallya says he didn\u2019t run away. \"I flew out of India on a pre-scheduled visit, right? I did not return for reasons that I consider valid. So, if you want to call me a fugitive, go ahead.

Since then, he has been living in the UK. The Indian government has officially listed him as a \"fugitive economic offender\". Mallya said \"money laundered\" does not mean he \"stole\" it. \"Laundered to me is trying to turn cash into a cheque and cheque into cash. That\u2019s laundering, right? If they (the Indian probe agencies) say I laundered the money, what are they saying I did with that money? Did I steal it? Did I fund my lifestyle with it? What "
